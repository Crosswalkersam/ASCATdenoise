# ASCATdenoise
This project aims to get rid of the vertical lines that occur on metOp ASCAT images.

# Requirements
For this script to work, you need Python 3 installed and added to PATH. 
After you installed Python on you machine, you need to install Image and matplotlib running
`pip install Image` and `pip install matplotlib`.

# Usage
After that, simply put an ASCAT-image named `input.png` into the same directory as the script.
Then you just have to run the script. That's it.
